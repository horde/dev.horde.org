Genie
Version 1.0

What is Genie?
--------------

Genie is the Horde wishlist application. It stores items for
wishlists, wedding registries, and similar uses. It is not tied to any
particular wishlist or wedding registry, and lets users share
wishlists with both guest users (the general buying public) and with
other users, at whatever permissions level is desired.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.
OSI Certified is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative.
