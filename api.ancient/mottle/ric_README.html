Mottle
Version 1.0

What is Mottle?
---------------

Mottle is a MOTD (Message of the Day) type application written in PHP
and utilizing the Horde Application Framework.

Now what?
---------

All installation documentation is located in the docs/ subdirectory

You MUST have the Horde framework installed on your system before you
install Mottle.

Read the docs/INSTALL file. It contains everything you need to know in
order to install Mottle on your system. (if it doesn't, it should, so
yell at us!)

Enjoy,
The Mottle Team
