Vacation is a Horde module for managing user e-mail &quot;vacation notices&quot; or
&quot;auto-responders.&quot; It works via a local vacation program and the .forward
style forwarding mechanism supported by several popular mailers.

Right now, Vacation provides fairly complete support for managing .forward
style vacation notices on Sendmail or Courier mail based systems via an FTP
transport. It also has some support for LDAP, Qmail, and SQL servers.

This software is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified is a
certification mark of the `Open Source Initiative`_.
